 # Task 5: Malware Types & Behavior Analysis (Basic)

## Objective
The objective of this task is to understand different types of malware, analyze their behavior using online malware analysis tools, and learn basic malware detection and prevention techniques.

---

## Tools Used
- **Primary Tool:** VirusTotal  
- **Alternative Tool:** Any.Run (Free Tier)

---

## Malware Types Studied
The following common malware types were studied as part of this task:

- **Virus:** Attaches itself to legitimate files and spreads when the infected file is executed.
- **Worm:** Self-replicates and spreads automatically through networks without user interaction.
- **Trojan:** Malicious software disguised as legitimate or useful programs.
- **Ransomware:** Encrypts user data and demands payment for decryption.
- **Spyware:** Collects sensitive user information without consent.
- **Adware:** Displays unwanted advertisements and may track user activity.
